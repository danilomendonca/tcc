  abstract = {The architecture of complex software or systems is a collection of hard decisions that are very expensive to change. Successful product development and evolution depend on making the right architectural choices. Can you afford not to identify and not to evaluate these choices? The authors of this book are experts in software architecture and its evaluation. They collected a wealth of ideas and experience in a well-organized and accessible form. If you are involved in the development of complex systems or software, you will find this book an invaluable guide for establishing and improving architecture evaluation practice in your organization. In particular, the book presents three important evaluation methods: Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM), Software Architecture Analysis Method (SAAM), and Active Reviews for Intermediate Designs (ARID). Detailed case studies demonstrate the value and practical application of these methods to real-world systems, and sidebars throughout the book provide interesting background and hands-on tips from the trenches.}

abstract={Although information technology (IT) is taking significant role in businesses with its innovating and supporting potential, it seems that it is least understood company asset. Successful organizations manage IT function in much the same way that they manage their other strategic functions and processes. This in particular means that they understand, manage and systematically measure the quality of IT performance. They are doing so by engaging in IT governance and IT audit activities. In recent years there are number of world-wide used standards and best practices in IT process management area such as CobiT and ITIL, which helps management to measure the IT performances. In this paper we present the case study of managing IT services in finance industry by implementing suggestions which arises from ITIL methodology. After brief explanation of key terms, the methodology of complex ITIL implementation project is given and key performance indicators for major IT related business processes stressed.},

abstract={The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a collection of best practices for the management of IT services. ITIL helps organizations to become aware of the business value their IT services provide to internal and external stakeholders. Understanding this value is crucial to the definition of service level agreements (SLA) between an IT department and its stakeholders. However, it is not ITIL's objective to define how this value is to be elicited from stakeholders. This creates an opportunity for the use of RE methods in businesses. This paper describes the main principles of ITIL service management and illustrates how the SEAM RE method can contribute to the definition of an SLA by modeling the service provided by an IT department, the stakeholders of this service and the value the stakeholders expect from this service. A real industrial example is presented and analyzed.},
